                <h2>Atmospheric Pressure & Tempreature:</h2>

            <div class="card-body">
                <p>
                    The atmospheric pressure on Mars is very thin (less than 1%) when compared to Earth and it has an
                    average
                    temperature of -62°C.
                </p>
                <p>
                    Mars does have polar caps, minerals, and soil that could provide sources of carbon dioxide (CO2)
                    and
                    water to thicken the atmosphere. And some have suggested that there is enough CO2 locked away
                    in
                    Mars's ice and rocks to heat the planet.
                </p>
                <p>
                    Over the years a number of ideas have been proposed on how to
                    access these.
                </p>
                <p>
                    But in 2018, two NASA-funded scientists found that at best, accessible CO2 could
                    only
                    increase the surface temperature by less than 10°C. They came to the conclusion that processing all
                    these
                    sources found on Mars would also only increase the atmospheric pressure to 7%.
                </p>
                <p>
                    They state, "even if enough CO2 were to be available, it would not be feasible to mobilise it; doing
                    so
                    would require processing a major fraction of the surface to release it into the atmosphere, which is
                    beyond
                    present-day technology".

                <p>
                    The surface gravity on Mars is 38% of that on Earth.
                <p>
                <p>
                    Because life on Earth has evolved over the past 3.5 billion years in an unchanging
                    gravitational field, it shouldn't be a surprise that so much of our physiology
                    appears
                    to
                    be defined by -- or dependent upon -- gravity.
                </p>
                <p>
                    At present, it is unknown what effects long-term exposure to this amount of gravity will have on the
                    human
                    body.
                </p>
                <p>
                    However, ongoing research into the effects of microgravity on astronauts has shown that it has
                    a
                    detrimental effect on health, which includes loss of muscle mass, bone density, organ function, and
                    even
                    eyesight.
                </p>
                <p>
                    If we wanted to terraform Mars and change it's gravity, some suggest it would mean we would have to
                    change
                    the overall mass of the planet itself!

            <div class="card-body">
                <p>
                    Earth's molten core creates a magnetic field surrounding our planet that helps to protect the
                    atmosphere
                    from the Sun. Harmful rays from the Sun are deflected by the magnetic field, so they don't hit the
                    atmosphere and damage it.
                </p>
                <p>
                    Billions of years ago, Mars used to have a global magnetic field, but it shut down for reasons that
                    are
                    still unknown, about 4 billion years ago, leaving the atmosphere unshielded to radiation and causing
                    it
                    to bleed over time into space.
                </p>
                <p>
                    Unfortunately, we can't just simply start it back up again. But one recent study suggests we could
                    create
                    an artificial one!
                </p>
                <p>
                    This study points out, if you want a good planetary magnetic field, what you really need is a strong
                    flow of charged particles around the planet. They argue, you can create a ring of charged particles
                    around Mars, by using its moon Phobos.
                </p>
                <p>
                    Phobos is the larger of the two Martian moons, and it orbits the planet quite closely. So, the team
                    proposes using Phobos by ionizing particles
                    from
                    its surface, then accelerating them so they create a ring-shaped cloud of ions along the orbit of
                    Phobos. They argue that this could create a magnetic field strong enough to protect a terraformed
                    Mars.... watch this space!
